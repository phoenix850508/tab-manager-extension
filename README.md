# tab-manager-extension
"tab manager extension" is a Chrome extension for people who find it is somewhat tricky to organize their tabs when there are many tabs opened. This extension can make your life easier by viewing all the opened tabs in a popup list, which you could view the titles of each tab much clearer in a glance. You can also categorize tabs into different categories, collapse/expand the grouped tabs or jump right into the tabs you'd like to focus with just one click on the popup tab list.
